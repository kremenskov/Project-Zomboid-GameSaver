# 'Project Zomboid' GameSaver

A simple tool that allows you to create any amount of save files and avoid deleting your saves and characters after frustrating mistakes in the game.

## How to use it?
1. Download **GameSaver.exe** script from repository.
2. Move script file to the directory with 'Project Zomboid' saves. Default directory is *C:/Users/Your_Username/Zomboid/Save*.
3. Create desktop shortcut if you want.
4. Double click on script icon (or shortcut) to create new savefile. Now your character will not be deleted and you can play 'Project Zomboid' as any other game.

## How does it work?
*Briefly:*

Script finds your last saved game, creates duplicate of folder and write current date and time as the name of new save. 

*Step by step:*
1. Script determines day and time and create name for new save.
2. It finds last modifided folder in the directory of saves.
3. It copies the content of last saved game and put it in a new folder.
4. It gives the new folder a name that was generated previously.

## Additional info
The game saves your character every time you close the application **or** go to main menu. It is the only way to actualise your save. So the best way to use this script: duplicate your save after each game session or exit to main menu before stressful moment in game, use script, and continue after that. 

**Glad if this little script makes your game easier and more enjoyable!**
